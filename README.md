## Form Validation :heavy_check_mark:

### About this project... :bulb:

This project is simply for the practice of the constraint validation API in JavaScript. I have created a simple form that takes in an email-address, a UK post-code, and a user-created password. If the form input receives any invalid data, the CSS selectors will highlight these in red until the input becomes valid in which it will highlight it green.

This project makes use of the `.setCustomValidity('')` API which is then displayed with an error message relevant to the input error.

### Future Improvements? :sparkles:

1. Mobile friendly :iphone:
1. Submit button validation :question:
1. Cleaner UI :trollface:
